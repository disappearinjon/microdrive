* BUG: Why are my omitempty-tagged JSON fields being included?
* Library: pretty-print for text output
* Nit: file output types based on filename?
* Documentation
* CLI: unit tests
* CLI: edit partition table command - interactive mode?

* Import separate file to partition - same size only

# Done

* To-Do list
* Add license
* Basic CLI: filename, print command
* Output formats for structure printing
* End() function on MDTurbo struct to simplify other code
* Validate function for partition table structure
